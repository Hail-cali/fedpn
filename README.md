# FedPN: Personalized Fedderated Learning on mobile network

> paper work for hail-cali at 2022 june
----

>FedPN proposes a way to defend the performance of a client model while creating a global model through novelty methods in non-iid situations. FedPN deals with the problem by applying multi-task learning appropriately to federated learning. In addition, FedPN presents ‘co-train’ algorithm that enables collaborative learning of networks generating different manifolds.
